    "# Connect4 Sprint 1:\n",

    "\n",
    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect4 is a game in which 2 players choose a color and take turns dropping colored tokens into a grid with raws and columns. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of n (4 by default) of one's own tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing a certain strategy.\n",

    "## Game Customization:\n",
    "\n",
    "We take the vanilla game of Connect 4 and we will first try to find the optimal strategy for a vanilla configuration, and then scale it up to a larger grid size, with larger required chains. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, we can add stochastic variables like a chance for a token to not go in its right column, or redirect the inputs of certain columns to go to others, but that is to come in the next sprint.\n"

    "\n",
    "In order to understand the problem in details and how to approach it, we utilized an open-source solution [by Daniel Hernandez](https://github.com/Danielhp95/gym-connect4). We have investigated it, researched the software package and collaborated to understand its way of operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next sprint we will alter, update, improve and extend it. In this sprint our main focus was to get us involved with the gymnasium, advance our skills in building MDPs, and understand better what is happening both conceptually and practically.\n"

    "## Terminal states:\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminal state can be reached in the following ways:\n",
    "  - Player A creates a connect4 (i.e., four connected tokens vertically, horizontally, diagonally)\n",
    "  - Player B creates a connect4 (vertically, horizontally, diagonally)\n",
    "  - All fields are filled up and no connect4 exists\n",

    "### Episode Length:\n",
    "\n",
    "Episode length is not needed to be strictly enforced due to the fact that a victory condition can easily be reached and the board size is not prohibitively large."

    "- Vladislav: I worked with Yordan on the understanding of the code and concepts in RL. Additionally, I was thinking about possible extentions in the next sprint.\n",

    "Both of us are directly involved with the whole process - analysis, design, research, software development, document writing. We discuss and collaborate to ensure that everybody is on the same page all the time and is involved with the project.\n"
