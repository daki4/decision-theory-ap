    "# Snake\n",
    "\n",
    "In snake, the player controls the head of a hypothetical snake that lives on a grid of squares, and is aiming to eat fruit, get longer, and avoid hitting walls and its body. It can be steered left, right, up, and down to avoid the obstacles. Fruit appears randomly in a square that is not occupied currently by the snake's body. The more fruit you have eaten, in the least amount of moves, the higher your score.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Starting conditions:\n",
    "- The fruit is put on a random square\n",
    "- The snake starts with a head and 2 blocks to denote its body\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment is constructed out of:\n",
    "- Playing field\n",
    "- Walls\n",
    "\n",
    "## State is constructed out of:\n",
    "- Position of head\n",
    "- Area occupied by the body\n",
    "- Position of fruit\n",
    "\n",
    "## The possible actions are:\n",
    "- `Move Left`\n",
    "- `Move Right`\n",
    "- `Move Up`\n",
    "- `Move Down`\n",
    "\n",
    "With just 3 of the actions possible at all times, because you can not steer back into yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reward will be:\n",
    "- punishment for hitting the wall or itself (ends the episode)\n",
    "- reward for getting the fruit\n",
    "- huge reward for entering terminal state\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminal states:\n",
    "- `Positive`: when the snake's body + head fill up the whole playing field\n",
    "- `Negative`: when the snake collides with the wall or itself (ends the episode)\n",

    "# Connect4\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect4 is a game in which 2 players choose a color (yellow and red) and then take turns \n",
    "dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column vertically suspended grid. \n",
    "The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the \n",
    "column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical,\n",
    "or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect Four is a solved game. The first player can always win by playing the right moves.\n",

    "- `Positive` reward when you enter terminal state\n",

    "# Sokoban\n",
    "\n",
    "Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse,\n",
    "trying to get them to storage locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The warehouse is depicted as a grid of squares, each one representing either a floor \n",
    "section or a wall section. Some floor squares contain boxes and some are marked as \n",
    "storage locations. The player, often represented as a worker character, can move one \n",
    "square at a time horizontally or vertically onto empty floor squares, but cannot pass \n",
    "through walls or boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To move a box, the player walks up to it and pushes it to the square beyond. Boxes\n",
    "cannot be pushed to squares with walls or other boxes, and they cannot be pulled. \n",
    "The number of boxes matches the number of storage locations. The puzzle is solved \n",
    "when all boxes occupy the storage locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sokoban game](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4b/Sokoban_ani.gif)\n",

    "- `Move Left`\n",
    "- `Move Right`\n",
    "- `Move Up`\n",
    "- `Move Down`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reward will be:\n",
    "- `Negative` reward when the agent puts the box in unsolvable position (immovable and is not in an end spot)\n",
    "- `Positive` reward when the agent enters Positive Terminal state\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminal states:\n",
    "- `Positive`: If all boxes are in an end spot\n",
    "- `Negative`: If a box enters in a state that will make it immovable and is not in an end spot\n",
